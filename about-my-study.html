        Because of that proverbe,parents are trying hard to teach their children.<br>
        Having been well taught and learned a lot is a big target, and that can help people to get good quality of life in
        the future.
        <p>
            There are several steps that students need in order to get the highest grade of education.<br>
            Unfortunetely, not everyone can achieve the highest grade as it depends on the supporters, and besides, some children
            don't even go to school as the reasult of poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every country have their own way and their own steps of education, so of course Madagascar has its own
            education too.<br>Therefore this is about my study which is not that high, let's see!!

                    <ins>EPP</ins> (<code>Ecole Primaire Public</code>)
                    <p>
                        I went to <abbr title="Ecole Primaire Public">EPP</abbr> school which is in EPP Ankazomianko
                        Vavatenina when I was 7.<br> There were 5 steps which I had to pass: 11<sup>émé</sup>,
                        10<sup>émé</sup>, 9<sup>émé</sup>, 8<sup>émé</sup> and 7<sup>émé</sup>. In 7<sup>émé</sup> there
                        is an exam public, which is called <abbr
                            title="Certificat d'Etudes Primaires Elémentaires">CEPE</abbr>, that every students have to
                        do in Madagascar.

                    <ins>CEG</ins> (<code>College d'Enseignement General</code>)
                    <p>
                        After the exam, I went to CEG school, that is in CEG Abatobe Vavatenina, in the middle
                        school.<br> There were 4 steps and then I did exam public again called <abbr
                            title="Brevet d'études du Premier Cycle">BEPC</abbr>, which every students have to face.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    Lycéé (<code>High school</code>)
                    <p>
                        I went to the high school which is in Lycéé Manampisoa Vavatenina when I was 16. I got my
                        Baccalaureat diplomat 2 years after that.

            <b>After school</b>
            <p>
                As I said before some parents do not have enough money to afford their children, so the children must
                leave school not in their purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                I left school after high school. I did some business to help my family to survive, hoped not to
                study at university or somewhere else anymore.

                Fortunately, ONJA appeared.

                is targeting disadvantaged youth with the most potential, and the really unique part is that these very
