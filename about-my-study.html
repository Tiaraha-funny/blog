        Because of that proverbe, people are trying hard to teach their children.<br>
        Having been well taught and learned a lot is a big target, that can help people to get good quality of life in the future.
        <p>
            There are several steps that students need in order to get the highest grade of education.<br>
             Unfortunetely, not everyone can achieve the highest grade as it depends on the supporter, some children don't even go to school as the reasult of poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every countries have their own way and their own steps of education, so of course Madagascar has its own education too.<br>So this is about my study which is not that high, let's see!!

                <ins>EPP</ins> (<code>Ecole Primaire Public</code>)
        <p>
            I went to <abbr title="Ecole Primaire Public">EPP</abbr> school which is in EPP Ankazomianko Vavatenina when I was 7.<br> There were 5 steps which i had to pass: 11<sup>émé</sup>, 10<sup>émé</sup>, 9<sup>émé</sup>, 8<sup>émé</sup> and 7<sup>émé</sup>. In 7<sup>émé</sup> there is an exam public, which called <abbr title="Certificat d'Etudes Primaires Elémentaires">CEPE</abbr>, that every students have to do in Madagascar.

                <ins>CEG</ins> (<code>College d'Enseignement General</code>)
            <p>
                After the exam, I went to CEG school, that is in CEG Abatobe Vavatenina, in the middle school.<br> There were 4 steps and then I did exam public again called <abbr title="Brevet d'études du Premier Cycle">BEPC</abbr>, Which every students have to face.

                Lycéé (<code>High school</code>)
            <p>
                I went to the high school which is in Lycéé Manampisoa Vavatenina when I was 16. I got my Baccalaureat diplomat 2 years after that. 
            </p>

        </ol>
        <b>After school</b>
        <p>
        As I said before some parents do not have enough money to afford their children, so the children must leave school not in their purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            I left school after my Baccalaureat. I did some business to help my family to survive, hoped not to study at university or somewhere else anymore.
