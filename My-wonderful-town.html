            <h3>
                The reason why it calls Vavatenina.
            </h3>
            <p>
                When there were colonisaters here in Madagascar, Vavatenina was still a very small town hidden in the forest. Before entered in that town you could see a gate made of some plants called "tenina".
            </p>
            <p>
                Gate means vavahady in malagasy and tenina is a kind of plant. They combined those two words and it becomes Vavatenina. That is the reason why they call it Vavatenina.
